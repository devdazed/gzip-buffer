# gzip-buffer

  GZips and GUnzips via a buffer rather than a stream
  
  The nodejs ZLib library is great when streaming compressed or uncompressed data,
  however, if you would like to store this data locally, (maybe for caching?)
  it is rather difficult. gzip-buffer will un/compress your data and callback
  with the results in a buffer.

# installation

    npm install gzip-buffer

# example

    var gbuf = require('gzip-buffer');
    
    gbuf.gzip('some data', function(zipped){
      gbuf.gunzip(zipped, function(unzipped){
        console.log(unzipped.toString());
      });
    });
